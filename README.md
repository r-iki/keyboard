   1. Click "Load unpacked".
   2. Navigate to and select the folder containing the manifest for Lushootseed
      input and push "Open".

2. Go to `chrome://settings/languages`.
   1. Select "Language" and ensure "English (United States)" is listed or add
      it if it is missing.

## How To Use

A new icon should appear in the status bar of Chrome OS indicating which
keyboard layout is active. The default for "SU Keyboard" will display as "SU".
Type `Shift+Ctrl+Space` to cycle through the available language and layout
options. The Lushootseed layout should be shown as "EN" though other layouts
also using the English layout will look that way as well.

Click the icon for a pop-up which will show all available layouts and which
is currently active. You may change layouts this way as well.
